# WolfGoatCabbage

Game starts with Wolf, Goat, Cabbage, and Farmer sitting on
one side of the river by the boat. The goal is to move all 4 to the other side of the river on the boat.
However, the boat only allows Farmer to take either Goat and Cabbage, Goat and Wolf or Wolf and
Cabbage at the same time. If Goat and Cabbage are left alone, goat eats Cabbage. If Goat and Wolf are
left alone, Wolf eats Goat. Player drag-and-drops (or selects) 3 shapes, e.g. (Farmer, Goat, Cabbage)
and presses a button, and the program moves them to the other side of the river in the boat. To move
back, player could pick just one of them, say Farmer, and press a buton. The program should move
Farmer alone in the boat to the other side of the river. If player solves the puzzle, they get a record in
the Hall of Fame. If player presses “Resign” button, the game offers to show solution. The program
should visualize the current state of the game at each step.
